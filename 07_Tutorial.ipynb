    "#### A Quick Aside: Defining a Path\n",

    "You can also define absolute or relative filepaths and use those filepaths as needed. A relative path is the path that is relative to the working directory location on your machine. An absolute path is a path that contains the entire path to the file or directory that you need to access. This path will begin at the home directory of your machine and will end with the file or directory that you wish to access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute paths ensure that Python can find the exact file on your machine. However, machines can have a different path constructions, depending on the operating system, and contain usernames that are unique to that specific machine. There are ways to overcome this issue and others associated with finding files on different machines. The `os.path.join()` and `os.path.exists()` functions are particularly useful for finding files on different machines.

In the example below, some employee data for a fictional company with 63 employees is presented in a table. \n",

    "### pandas DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can use the Python Data Analysis Library (pandas) to work with tabular data. This library provides the tools and data structures we need to effectively work with data. To do so, we need to load pandas in our notebook. Recall that we can simplify its name based on standard convention as we will use it over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, the primary data structure is a `DataFrame`. This is what we will use to represent and interact with our data. For those of you who have experience with *R Statistical Software*, you are likely already familiar with the concept of a data frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is it exactly? A pandas `DataFrame` is a 2-dimensional data structure. It can store data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, categorical, and more) in columns. Stated another way, it is a table with rows and columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the fictional employee data example provided above to highlight the qualities of a DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each row is a single *observation*: an employee.\n",
    "  * That means that the data in a row are *related* to each other.\n",
    "  * In this case, the values in a row all correspond to a single employee.\n",
    "* Each column is a single *variable*: employee ID, tenure, leadership, title.\n",
    "  * Columns are *named* (e.g., 'Tenure_Months' is the name of the second column).\n",
    "  * All columns within a DataFrame contain the same number of items and rows (63 in this example).\n",
    "  * Each variable has a specific data type (string, integer, boolean, categorical in this example, respectively).\n",
    "    * Note that while different columns may have different types, *each column must contain only one type of data*!\n",
    "    * In Python, you may encounter a `None` object which represents the absence of a value (or a null value) in a column.\n",
    "    * You may also encounter a `NaN` (Not a Number) object which represents undefined or nonsensical numerical values.\n",
    "    * [Here's a Medium article describing the difference between None and NaN](https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/none-nan-null-and-zero-in-python-ac326cfb73a2).\n",

    "#### Data Frame Differences: R vs. Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Data frames are built into base R. This means that the functions, commands, and other operations within R work very well with data frames. In contrast, data frames are provided by an external package (pandas) in Python. This means that data frames are not as well integrated in Python as in R. To help overcome this limitation, we can rely on data science libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn. Keep in mind that software updates may break the functionality of data frames. You may need to revert back to an older version of a library/module/package to regain functionality. I tend to prefer R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization due to these and  other reasons. \n",

    "\n",
    "If the fictional employee data table provided above were stored in a spreadsheet, we could import it in Python as a pandas DataFrame.

    "```Python\n",
    "employees = pd.read_csv(\"employee_data.csv\")\n",
